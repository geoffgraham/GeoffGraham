== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is CodePen? = 

[CodePen](http://codepen.io/ "CodePen") is an Online development site that allows you to build and share code made from HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

= What is a Pen? = 

A [CodePen](http://codepen.io/ "CodePen") Pen is an indiviual project you make on CodePen.

= Do I need a CodePen account to use this plugin? =

No, if a Pen is public you can still embed it on your WordPress site.

= I put in the URL but I got an error. =

You don't need the full URL in the URL feild. All that's required in the URL feild is the last part of the Pen's URL.

For example, if the Pen's URL is http://codepen.io/usernam/pen/ycLhI. All you need is the "ycLhI" part of the URL.

= Why did you make this plugin? Can't I just use the embed code that's provided on the CodePen website? =

Yes, you can just use the embed code used on the [CodePen](http://codepen.io/ "CodePen") wedsite. 

The reason I created this plugin is because I found that some syntax highlighter plugins cause a conflict with the [CodePen](http://codepen.io/ "CodePen") embeding code. Cusing the embeded Pen to not display.

It is also safer for you website to add code with a shortcode rather that just putting the raw code in the editor.
